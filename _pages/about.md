STILL IN PROGRESS

Hello! I'm Cristian — a chemist with a passion for scientific research, communication, and innovation. I specialize in polymer synthesis and analytical method development, and I love transforming complex ideas into tangible products.

### My Background

With a solid foundation in chemistry and experience working in both academic and industrial labs, I bring a rigorous approach to problem-solving and a deep appreciation for the scientific method.

I enjoy working at the intersection of theory and application, where I can contribute to both understanding and impact.

### Outside the Lab

When I'm not working on experiments or analyzing data, I enjoy:

- Reading sci-fi and fantasy books
- Walking my Dog
- Exploring mystical worlds in DND.

### Let’s Connect

If you’re interested in collaborating or just want to talk science, feel free to [contact me](/contact/) or connect on social media.
